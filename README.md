# GOAT- goTenna Object and Access Tracker

This is modified section of goTenna app, an mobile application which connects off-grid device goTenna to the cell phone using Bluetooth. In this research project, off-grid device goTenna was used to create an ad-hoc wireless network between wildland firefighters. The SDK provided by the goTenna team was a simple texting GUI. Our team modified the SDK to implement functionalities which would help firefighters in emergency situations. These functionalites are:
  •	Send and receive text and GPS coordinates on the app
  •	Broadcast user's location every one minute
  •	Provide location tracking feature of the user
  •	Provide location tracking feature of the other users
  •	Send and receive polygons describing an area via the app
  •	Store all the messages and location for forensics
  •	Ability to log information to a remote web server if the mobile device has 3G/Wi-Fi connection

The Colorado Center of Excellence’s Pilatus PC-12 Multi-Mission Aircraft (MMA) is equipped with a state-of-the-art L-3 Wescam MX-15 motion imagery electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera ball that takes highly detailed aerial shots of the location of the fire or any other area the wildland firefighters are currently deployed.  These shots depict the potential hot-spots, fire range, recent fire developments and other aspects relevant to forest fires. However, there is no way to communicate this mission-critical information to the wildland firefighters on ground zero. Our app would try to provide a solution to solve this problem. To convey the information received from the Wescam of the MMA, the app  allows you to select a specific area and send information about this field to the wildland firefighters.
